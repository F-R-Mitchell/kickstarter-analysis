Louise should consider lowering her goal for a musical in Great Britain to below $2000 to raise her chances of success.

# Analysis of the Results for Kickstarter_Challenge
---
## The purpose of this analysis was to fulfill Louise's request to know how projects progressed based on their launch dates and funding goals. Using the knowledge from the outcome of the analysis, Louise can better determine when is best time to launch a project as well as how much she should request for funding.

## I began by analyzing the outcomes of theater projects based on launch date. As seen on - ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87910875/131050642-f879f9cc-6337-4f8a-84e2-9221dcca12f2.png)

The most successful time to launch a theater project is during the month of May, even though the highest rate of failures is during the same month. I then analyzed outcomes of plays based on the goals of each project using ranges as seen on - ![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87910875/131050693-7f62b9c7-da63-4c49-9359-ce5eb06ba4e7.png)
The chart displays that the most successful goal range is between $0 and $4,999. A challenge that encountered, though foolish, was not having the right greater than or less than signs within the formula which created significantly different results.

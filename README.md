# Analysis of the Results for Kickstarter_Challenge
## Overview of The Project
The purpose of this analysis was to fulfill Louise's request to know how projects progressed based on their launch dates and funding goals. Using the knowledge and data from the outcome of the analysis within [Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx](https://github.com/F-R-Mitchell/kickstarter-analysis/files/7071715/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx), Louise can better determine when is the best time to launch a project as well as how much she should request for funding.

## Analysis and Challenges
I began by analyzing the outcomes of theater projects based on launch date. As seen on - ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87910875/131050642-f879f9cc-6337-4f8a-84e2-9221dcca12f2.png)

The most successful time to launch a theater project is during the month of May, even though the highest rate of failures is during the same month. I then analyzed outcomes of plays based on the goals of each project using ranges as seen on - ![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87910875/131050693-7f62b9c7-da63-4c49-9359-ce5eb06ba4e7.png)
The chart displays that the most successful goal range is between $0 and $4,999. A challenge that encountered, though foolish, was not having the right greater than or less than signs within the formula which created significantly different results.

# Result
## Conclusions for Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
A conclusion that can be made about Theater Outcomes by Launch Date is that the slope of the success rate during the first half of the year is positive while the slope of the second half is negative. This could possibly mean that it is better to launch a theater project during the first half of the year than to wait until the second half. Another conclusion that can be made is that December is the worst month to launch a project due to it being the only month where you have an almost equal chance to succeed or fail.

## Conclusion for Outcomes Based on Goals
A conclusion for outcomes based on goal is that the worst goals to launch a project is between $15,000 and $35,000. This is due to the rate of success and the rate of failure is flipped, causing the rate of failure to be, sometimes significantly, higher than the rate of success. 

## Limitations of the Dataset
A limitation of the data set could be the personal interests of the viewers. For example, projects that had a goal of $45,000 - $49,999 had a 0% success rate while projects that had a goal of $50,000+ had a 12.5% success rate. This could possibly mean that the goal wasn't the only factor that people had in mind when deciding to donate to the project. 

## Other Possible Tables/Graphs
Another graph that could've been created is a scatter plot. I think it could show possible correlations between two sets of data. For example, showing the correlation between backer count and goal. I also think a histogram could be helpful in seeing the skew or symmetry of the goal data set within each subcategory.
